# _About Me_

I am in the midst of my Ph.D. journey at KyungHee University, specializing in Solar Physics. My research is deeply rooted in uncovering the intricate mechanisms that operate within the Sun. Leveraging advanced numerical simulations, I aim to create comprehensive models of the Sun's inner dynamics. My academic pursuits have consistently revolved around solar phenomena. The enigmatic internal processes of the Sun, which play a pivotal role in driving its dynamics and associated phenomena, have always captivated my interest.

Beyond my primary research focus, I am deeply involved in high-performance computing (HPC). My passion lies in elevating parallel performance through tools like OpenMP, MPI, and their combined hybrid approach. Alongside these, I am also intrigued by optimization techniques such as cache blocking, which serves to further optimize computational efficiency in the parallel environment. The meticulous process of optimization, the joy of seeing improved parallel efficiencies, is what fuels my passion. This interplay of solar physics and computational physics guides my journey to decode nature's multifaceted intricacies.

**My Advisor: Prof. Tetsuya Magara**

We aim to clarify the dynamical nature of the Sun represented by various kinds of active phenomena observed on it, such as the solar cycle, solar flare, and coronal mass ejection. We investigate origins, basic properties, and physical mechanisms of these phenomena by combining observational data analysis and theoretical modeling based on computer simulation.

### Our Research Targets

1. **Dynamic Recycling of Magnetic Fields in the Solar Interior (Solar Cycle)**

2. **Dynamic Transportation of Magnetic Flux Through the Solar Convection Zone to the Solar Atmosphere (Magnetoconvection, Flux Emergence)**

3. **Dynamic Formation and Explosion of Magnetic Structures in the Solar Atmosphere (Solar Prominences/Filaments, Sigmoids, Solar Flares)**

4. **Global Eruption of Magnetic Structures Toward the Interplanetary Space (Coronal Mass Ejections)**

Toward this end, we are currently developing a state-of-the-art, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation model which will be used to explore the solar interior and exterior.
